<li><p>When you look for houses online, the pictures and information might not show what the houses are really like. This can make people miss out on good houses just because of the online listings. To fix this, we need a creative solution that uses Virtual Reality (VR) to make the online house-hunting experience better, helping real estate agents sell more houses. This challenge asked us participants to think about how we show houses online. The goal is to create a simple VR platform for real estate agents that connects the online world with the real world. With this platform, people looking for houses can explore them virtually and get a feel for the layout and atmosphere. By taking people on a virtual tour, this technology can change the way we see houses online, making it more interesting and informative. It can also use AI and ML to provide insights and suggestions while people explore houses. </p></li>
